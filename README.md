# Hello!
My name is @Logan-Dang and I'm a student at San Jose State University
## I’m interested in...
I'm still new to coding/programming, so I have a lot of different interests. If I had to pick a top 3, they would be Game Development, Financial Technology, and Desktop App Development!
## I’m currently learning...
Right now, I'm focused on learning how to build desktop apps. Right now I'm working on combining React, Electron, and Typescript to build a personal project (public soon!).
## I’m looking to collaborate on...
Everything! I want to really explore what's out there in the software engineering world and push my skills. Please feel free to invite me to collaborate with you on pretty much anything.
